## Overview
The Arduino-Based Solar Tracking System is a project designed to optimize the efficiency of solar panels by automatically tracking the sun's position throughout the day. This system allows your solar panels to constantly face the sun, maximizing energy generation.

## Demo

## Features
- Automatic tracking of the sun's position.
- Real-time adjustment of solar panel angles.
- Improved energy generation from solar panels.
- User-configurable settings.
- Calibration for your specific location.

## Materials and Components
To build this solar tracking system, you will need the following materials and components:
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Servo motors (2)
- Light sensors (2)
- Solar panels
- Mounting structure
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)
- Power supply


 ##### Upload the Arduino code (found in the arduino_code directory) to your - Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

##### Assemble the hardware components according to the circuit diagram provided in the docs folder.

## Usage
- Power on the system.

- The solar tracking system will automatically start tracking the sun's position.

- Monitor the system's performance and energy generation.

## Configuration
To customize the solar tracking system for your location, follow these steps:

- Open the Arduino code in the Arduino IDE.

- Locate the configuration section in the code.

- Adjust the latitude and longitude coordinates for your location.

- Modify any other parameters as needed (e.g., tracking sensitivity).

- Upload the updated code to your Arduino board.
